            <p>This is an introductory article about the syntax and main characteristics of python.</p>
            <p>We are going to be using python 3, the latest version of python up to date. </p>
            <p>I strongly recommend following along as I explain these concepts.</p>
            <p>I suggest downloading an IDE. My preffered choice is PyCharm, but you can choose whatever IDE you find suitable for you.</p>

            <p>As you can see in the above image python has several characteristics</p>
            <p>You can study the image, however the most important things that you should remember are these: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Python is a high level programming language. This means that it is easier to understand and write for humans, compared to languages like C or Java.</li>
            <li>Python is an interpreted language. It is first interpreted (by an interpreter) into another language before being turned into shell code, readable by computers (in this case it is interpreted in C).</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>Data types</h2>
            <p>By Andrei Fulga, Posted on 05.05.2020</p>
            <img src="photos/Python-data-structure.jpg" alt="python - data types" width = "600" height = "400">
            <p>In python just like several other rprogramming languages, there are some data types predefined. These include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>integers</li>
                <li>characters</li>
                <li>floating point numbers</li>
                <li>strings</li>
                <li>boolean</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Unlike other programming languages, in python you do not have to mention the data type before declaring a variable.</p>
            <p>With these data types you can do several operations like addition (x+y), substraction (x-y), multiplication (x*y) and many more depending on which data types you use.</p>

            <h2>Decisional structures</h2>
            <p>By Andrei Fulga, Posted on 06.05.2020</p>
            <p>In Python we often want to execute diferent instructions depending on the truth value of a certain situation. </p>
            <p>For example, if we want to see whether a number is positive or not we can use an "if..." statement.</p>
            <img src = "photos/python-if.png" alt = "python - if" width = "600" height = "400">
            <p>As we can see in the image above, the program checks if the number satisfies a given condition. If it does, then it goes to one branch of the code. If it doesn't then it goes on the other branch.</p>

            <h2>Loops</h2>
            <p>By Fulga Andrei, Posted on 07.05.2020</p>
            <p>A loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.</p>
            <p>Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</p>
            <p>In python there are 2 types of loops:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>while loops, which can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</li>   
                <li>for loops, that are used for iterating over a sequence (like a list for example)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The above image is a logical representation of a for loop</p>
